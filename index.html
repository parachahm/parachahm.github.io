			<h3>What is IAW?</h3>
			<p>Islamic Awareness Week (IAW) is an initiative taken upon by the Muslim Student Association. It is an annual student-based initiative geared towards breaking stereotypes about Islam and Muslims. It attempts to create a safe and engaging platform where Muslims and people of other faiths can interact with each other and engage in fruitful dialogue about matters that concern both. It also provides opportunities for people of other faiths to meet with Muslim scholars, listen to their lectures, and ask them questions. IAW aims to bring together students of different faiths in harmony to focus on challenges that are common to all. It will also provide Muslims students the opportunity to represent their faith on campus, and bring to the forefront challenged facing them specifically as a relatively new immigrant group to Canada, and to speak about what it means for them to be Canadian Muslims. At the end of they day, the IAW team essentially aims to provide an inspirational retreat where one can question their own spirituality and broaden their understanding of Islam.</p>
			<p>A variety of activities will be held to create a welcoming atmosphere including interactive booths, creative displays, educational literature and free activities such as Henna booths, Photo booths, etc. Additionally, we will continue the trend from last year and have a Spirituality/Prayer Tent - exclusively designed as a relaxing haven for individuals to explore their personal relationship with God or even just to have a peaceful moment for prayer/meditation in a stimulating environment.</p>
			<p>Every night a special event will be held. This includes lectures from Muslim of different backgrounds and walks of life and Islamic Scholars. We will be having a poetry slam, a case study competition, a Multi-Faith panel as well as a Converts panel. We are trying to promote our Muslim students by displaying their artwork and talents. Additionally, there will be free food and prizes given out throughout the event.</p>

			<h3>Our theme this year!</h3>
			<p>Islamic Awareness Week this year has the general theme of "Humans of Islam". Our IAW team chose this theme because we wanted to highlight the common humanity that all people share. We feel that the best way to respond to anti-Muslim bigotry is to highlight the diversity of Muslims, the commonalities between Islam and other faiths, and to encourage the empowerment of Muslim women. Thus, these are our sub themes for each of the three days that IAW will take place in the Great Hall in the SLC. Throughout the event, we will attempt to highlight specific Muslims, contemporary and historic, who have embodied or advocated for our sub themes.</p>
